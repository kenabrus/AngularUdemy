Two-Way-Binding
Important: For Two-Way-Binding (covered in the next lecture) to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive. This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.
You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
